  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How can I save my default company data for future re-use?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    This data is stored in the <ib-span class="ib_code">data.js</ib-span> file so you can easily edit it with any text editor.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    To save your logo, you'll need to supply base64 encoded data URI of it (simply put - text representation of the image). No matter how scary this might sound, the only thing you need to do is drag and drop your logo to this template and then click on it. A popup window will show with generated base64 data URI (long string of characters) of the logo, which you need to copy and paste it in the <ib-span class="ib_code">data.js</ib-span> file (into the value of the <ib-span class="ib_code">{company_logo}</ib-span> property). That's all.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    The data and the structure of the data.js file is quite simple and self-explanatory. Any questions whatsoever, feel free to hit us up at <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('mailto:support@invoicebus.com', '_blank')">support@invoicebus.com</ib-span> - you'll be hearing from us very soon!
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How to save the invoice?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    This one is a bit tricky. Due to the limitation of how browsers work with local html files, we haven’t figured out yet how to store any dynamic data you enter, such as items, prices, taxes, etc. However, you have few other alternatives
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_ul">
    <ib-div class="ib_li">
      - &nbsp; Use the embedded PDF printer in Google Chrome.
    </ib-div>
    <ib-div class="ib_li">
      - &nbsp; Use free PDF print driver such as <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://www.foxitsoftware.com', '_blank')">Foxit Reader PDF Printer</ib-span> or <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://www.bullzip.com', '_blank')">BullZip</ib-span>.
    </ib-div>
    <ib-div class="ib_li">
      - &nbsp; Use the green "Save" button that will take you to our online invoicing service <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com', '_blank')">Invoicebus</ib-span> (which happens to be a great tool by the way) and securely store it into your personal account.
    </ib-div>
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    While the first two options will generate static PDF version of the invoice (which cannot be modified), the third option will generate live online invoice (<ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com/demoinvoice', '_blank')">like this</ib-span>) which can be edited on-the-fly, sent by email, tracked, and paid directly. You will also be able to re-use every item, client, and tax so you can write invoices goddamn fast in the future. 
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How to restyle the template?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    As the template is completely separate from its logic, you can easily restyle it by using simple HTML and CSS techniques. However, there are few rules which are consider to be good practice when making structural changes (deleting or rearranging elements) of the DOM, so have in mind to follow <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://invoicebus.com/how-to-create-invoice-template/', '_blank')">this guide</ib-span>.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Do I have to be connected to internet to use it?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Yes, but isn't necessary. In the background the template links to remote JavaScript file (<ib-span class="ib_code">generator.min.js</ib-span>) located on our server from which it pulls all the logic. If for some reason you don't have internet access on your computer, you can <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://cdn.invoicebus.com/generator/generator.zip', '_blank')">download</ib-span> the script locally, and modify the <ib-span class="ib_code">template.html</ib-span> file to point to the local version of the script.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    We generally encourage you to use the remote script because we're constantly improving it, so any recent updates immediately reflect into the template you're using.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">And what about the fonts used?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    The template uses Google Fonts as they are free and open to everyone. If you want to use the template offline you’ll have to download and install the fonts on your computer (<ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('http://www.fonts.com/web-fonts/google', '_blank')">SkyFonts</ib-span> is a simple tool that helps you do this easily).
  </ib-div>


  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Can I use the JavaScript source code?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Absolutely! In fact, we would be proud if you decide to use it (<ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/invoicebus/invoice-generator', '_blank')">fork us on GitHub</ib-span>). Weather you choose to use it in commercial or non-commercial project, feel free to give us a shout as we are eager to hear all possibilities of how this tool can be used. Sometimes, we may even give you a hand ;)
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Support our work</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Maintaining this script takes a lot of time and effort to keep it bug free and up to date. All we're asking is a little favor – discrete fine print of our invoicing service at the bottom of the printed document. It would mean the world to us if you put it there. Thanks!
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    It's fine even if you decide to avoid giving us credit, so we made this choice easier for you. In the <ib-span class="ib_code">data.js</ib-span> file we included property called <ib-span class="ib_code">invoicebus_fineprint</ib-span> which can be set to <ib-span class="ib_code">true</ib-span> (to show the fine print) or <ib-span class="ib_code">false</ib-span> (to hide the fine print).
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_h3">Suggestions, questions, criticism?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    Is there anything we can do to improve this template and make it better for you? Good things / bad things about it? Feel free to write us at <ib-span class="ib_a" onclick="window.open('mailto:support@invoicebus.com', '_blank')">support@invoicebus.com</ib-span> – we personally review every email.
