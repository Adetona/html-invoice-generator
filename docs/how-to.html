  <ib-div class="ib_h3">How can I change the invoice data?</ib-div>
  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    When using this generator you'll probably want to save your own company data so you can use it in future without typing it again in the template. To achieve this just edit the <ib-span class="ib_code">data.js</ib-span> file with your own default info.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    To set custom logo that will be loaded every time you use the Invoice Generator you'll need to supply base64 encoded data URI of PNG image. You can get this base64 data URI when you click on the logo after uploading one to this template.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
    When printing the invoice you may notice at the footer that we include fine print text about our invoicing service Invoicebus. We appreciate if you leave it there, but if you want you can remove it with setting the property <ib-span class="ib_code">invoicebus_fineprint</ib-span> to <ib-span class="ib_code">false</ib-span>.
  </ib-div>

  <ib-div class="ib_p">
