{"name":"Html Invoice Generator","tagline":"JavaScript tool that will transform your HTML invoice template to fully functional invoice editor","body":"# HTML Invoice Generator\r\n\r\nThis Invoice Generator will easily transform your HTML invoice template in fully functional invoice editor. To create your own invoice template and use it with this generator see the [Create your own invoice template](#create-your-own-invoice-template) section.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nTo make changes to the generator you'll need Node.js with npm so make sure it is installed on your machine. After this install grunt command line tool globally with:\r\n\r\n`npm install -g grunt-cli`\r\n\r\nAnd from the project's root install the dependencies with:\r\n\r\n`npm install`\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nFor easier development you can watch all files for changes and use auto livereload with the default task `grunt`.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nTo build the generator just run `grunt dev` or `grunt prod` on the command line. Those will produce fully functional template and generator files in the `dist` folder. The production version will produce minimized JavaScript and CSS files unlike the development version which is meant for easier debugging.\r\n\r\n## Supported browsers\r\n\r\nThe generator script is tested and confirmed that is fully functional in:\r\n\r\n* Chrome\r\n* Firefox\r\n* Safari 6+\r\n* Opera 15+\r\n* Internet Explorer 10+\r\n\r\n## Create your own invoice template\r\n\r\nThe major rule we have for this is **never start from scratch** so we encourage you to download the default Invoicebus [template](http://cdn.invoicebus.com/generator/template.zip) and use it as starting point for creating your custom invoice template. Refer to our [official guide](https://invoicebus.com/how-to-create-invoice-template/) on how to further customize your template.\r\n\r\n## Issues and feedback\r\n\r\nIf you found bugs please submit them [here](https://github.com/Invoicebus/html-invoice-generator/issues).
